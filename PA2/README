The biggest problem that I encountered with this project was in my
CalendarEvent.cpp file when I was trying to implement the CalendarEvent
constructor to create the object and store the date and time values.
I could not figure out why it kept printing default garbage values after
the variables were passed into the CalendarEvent object, but after further
analysis I realized it was because I had not set the values into the object.

I then decided to create setters for the CalendarEvent object so that I could
set the values when I created the instance of Date and Time classes in the
constructor. This project was very helpful for me because it helped me
practice implementing everything we have learned with classes and filestreams
to accomplish one goal, printing a calendar of events or appointments.
